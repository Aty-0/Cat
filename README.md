# Cat
A "Cat" is a experimental way for me to build a game engine. 
Features:
 - This engine is support scripting on a LUA programing language.
 - In engine game editor, etc

## What's will be added 
  - Serialization
  - Full functional scene editor
  - Better UI
  - 3D related stuff
  - Shader, texture editor and hot reload for it
  - Script component (Will be work like in Unity)
  
## Can I use it now ?
Yes. But currently it's a not "Alpha" or "Pre alpha" project, it's a very very early prototype! So, it's too raw to use, but if you are interested you can use it.
It's free to use.

Here's is a list of third party libs:

- sol2
- glew-2.2.0
- glfw
- glm
- lua-5.4.6
