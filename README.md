 - This engine is supports a scripting LUA programming language and have a basic API for scripts
 - In engine game editor
 - Component system for game objects

## What's will be added 
  - Serialization
  - UI
  - 3D related stuff
  - Shader, texture editors and hot reload for it
  - Script component (Will be work like in Unity)
  - Hot reload for scripts
  
## Can I use it now ?
Yes. But currently it's a not "Alpha" or "Pre alpha" project, it's a very very early prototype! 
So, it's too raw to use, but if you are interested you can use it and maybe help with development.
It's free to use.
