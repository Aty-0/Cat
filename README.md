# Cat
A "Cat" is a experimental way for me to build a game engine. 
This engine is support scripting on a python programing language, where I extend some API from engine and try make it simple as I can.

## Can I use it now ?
Currently it's a not "Alpha" or "Pre alpha" is a very very early prototype!

So, If you are see-read this ugly preview, and you are more expirenced than me, you can leave issue or pull request if you are want to read my bad and ugly code.

## What's this engine uses ?
Here's is a list of libs:

boost_1_82_0

glad

glfw

glm
